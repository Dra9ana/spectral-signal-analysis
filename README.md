# Spectral Signal Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the implementation of spectral density estimation methods using Matlab/Octave, focusing on various random processes. The primary objective is to analyze CSV data files and evaluate the performance of different spectral estimation techniques.

## Objectives
- Implement methods for spectral density estimation:
  - Periodogram
  - Welch's Method
  - Blackman-Tukey Method
- Analyze the performance of these methods on real-world signals.
- Visualize results and draw conclusions from the spectral analyses.

## Methods Implemented
1. **Periodogram**: Basic spectral density estimation method.
2. **Welch's Method**: Improved periodogram estimation using overlapping segments.
3. **Blackman-Tukey Method**: Utilizes windowing techniques to reduce spectral leakage.

## Achievements
- Successfully implemented and compared three spectral density estimation methods.
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the impact of windowing and overlapping on spectral estimates.
- Generated informative visualizations to aid in understanding the performance of each method.
- Developed a robust set of scripts that can easily handle different datasets and parameter configurations.
